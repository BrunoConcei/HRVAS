## Program Description

HRVAS is a complete and self-contained heart rate variability analysis software     (HRVAS) package. HRVAS offers several preprocessing options. HRVAS offers time-domain, freq-domain, time-frequency, and non-linear HRV analysis. All results can be exported to an Excel file. For processing many files HRVAS offers a bach processing feature. All settings/options can be saved to a .mat file and reloaded for future HRV analysis. Upon starting HRVAS all previously used settings/options are loaded.
