HRVAS offers several preprocessing options. HRVAS offers time-domeain, freq-domain, time-frequency, and nonlinear HRV analysis. All results can be exported to an Excel file. For processing many files HRVAS offers a bach processing feature. All settings/options can be saved to a .mat file and reloaded for future HRV analysis. Upon starting HRVAS all previously used settings/options are loaded.\r\n\r\n## MATLAB Toolbox Dependencies:\r\n\r\n    1. Signal Processing Toolbox (used for PSD estimates)\r\n    2. Wavelet Toolbox (used for wavelet and wavelet packet detrending)\r\n    3. Curvefitting Toolbox (only needed if using the \"smooth\" function for detrending)\r\n\r\n## Contact Information:\r\n    \r\n    John T.
